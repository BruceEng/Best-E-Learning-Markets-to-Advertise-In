This project uses data analysis to determine best markets to advertise in.

## Project Description & Goal

**Fiction:** I'm going to write this up as a fictional assignment.

### Description:

I work for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. **Most of our courses are on web and mobile development**, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. **Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in**.

I was handed a wheelbarrow load of survey based data by our marketing senior management team. The commission was: **<span style="color:red">'Here, analyze this</span>**. We have a limited amount of advertising dollars in our budget. Find out from the data the two best markets for us to advertise in and capture a high influx of new customers for e-learning training. **Have it done before we get back from our 'Communication Training'!**
